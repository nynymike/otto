## Review of IIW Session on OTTO

- See Notes: http://iiw.idcommons.net/OTTO_%3D_Open_Trust_Taxonomy_OAuthz_/_Session#1_Charter
   
Turnout for the IIW session was pretty good. Probably around 15-20 people. We were luckily able to find out that Judith might be able to help at this session! Also some great feedback from Roland Hedberg and Andrew Hughs.

## Discussion of Charter

- Draft charter: https://github.com/nynymike/otto/blob/master/kantara/charter.md 

- Joni Brennan said it looks "simple and focused." We have to finalize the proposers. 

## Meeting Logistics

We're going to keep using Gotomeeting for now. If it presents problems for Linux users in the future, we can re-consider. 

This time: "Weds 8am Pacific Time" will be recurring. Any earlier is not really possible for US west coast.

Future meetings will be scheduled for 60 minutes, but 90 minutes might needed toward the end.

## Collection / documentation of use cases

We want to make a list of use cases, which will help us to establish the scope. Mike will make a use-cases folder in the Github project, and we can add a one page summary for each use case. Just to give an example, we discussed a few use cases on the call (although this is not the full list):
       - Person Enrollment (in the context of municipal... how does a person get an id from the federation)
       - Client registration -- perhaps dynamic client registration is too promiscuous, while manual registration too paranoid, and the federation can provide a mechanism for curated client registration.
       - Multi-IDP trust: automatically choose an IDP in the region where you live
       - Personal / Organizational Discovery : In some cases, some discover information may be available only to certain trusted clients (or people using those clients). How could this worK?

## Github

I created a repo at https://github.com/nynymike/otto

I will checkin meeting minutes, the charter, and uses cases folder there. 

Please email mike@gluu.org with your github username to get added as a collaborator. Ideally Kantara would have a github project, so if this is the case, we'll move it there when possible.

## Action Items:
       - Ask Don Thibeau if there is overlap with Open Idenitity Exchange, which could benefit from a machine readable way to establish trust.
       - Submit any suggestions on the charter by the meeting next Wed
       - Commit any use cases for discussion next week


## Documentation format

Mike forgot to mention this, but he would like to suggest using Mkdocs for the documentation output of the WG. See http://www.mkdocs.org for more info. This would enable the group to leverage Github markdown formatting, but would provide a nice way to publish the site as formatted HTML. An inital mkdocs site has already been checked in under the [docs](../docs) folder in github.
