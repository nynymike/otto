## Discussion of Use Cases

We briefly reviewed all the use cases that have been under consideration.

**entity-discovery** 

The central authority vets and publishes metadata. 
*  OpenID Connect OP
*  UMA AS
*  UMA RS
*  UMA client
*  OpenID Connect RP
*  Federation?

**Schema** 
*  user claims
*  client claims
*  acrs
*  amrs
*  openid connect scopes
*  uma scopes.

**client-registration**
  How to enable a federation participant to enroll a client.

**security-incident-response**
   Maintain parity with SAML unless there are any good ideas to improve.

**security-collaboration**
  Facilate sharing of threat information between participants. Optional, 
  but perhaps could help--need to learn more.

**Trustmark**
  An alternate crypto mechanism to show participation in the federation.
  Could be useful where you can't publish a list of federation members.
  Trustmark is perhaps a loaded term.

**trust-elevation** 
  A good use case, but perhaps just confirms that we have the above right...

**Person-enrollment** 
  I don't understand this use case. Perhaps Dazza's group could add some more detail.

**Aggregated Authz**
  Perhaps there are multiple UMA AS's and multiple IDPs, and the federation acts as 
  a proxy... Mike suggested it, but doesn't like the idea anymore in OTTO.

## Deliverables

- Federation Metadata schema and signing

- endpoints:  /join  /leave
              Federation metadata discovery? As George suggests, maybe its just
              webfinger, which has query capabilities.

## CIS Next Week

Probably we will cancel the call next week due to Cloud Identity Summit.
