## Kantara Process

Special guest, Joni Brennan, Executive Director for Kantara Initiative  
brief us on Kantara the processes.

First of all, Joni said congrats on forming the working group, and thanks for
your participation! She then reviewed some of the important Kantara procesesses
we need to know about as we develop OTTO.

One of the first thing we have to do is open nominations for leadership. When we wrote 
the charter, we proposed Mike and Janusz as co-chairs. But all suggestions about leadership 
positions,  are welcome--send a message to the mailing list, email Mike, or send a message to 
staff@kantarainitiative.org if you have any ideas or questions.

All members must officially join the by completing the 
Group Participation Agreement, OTTO WG from the "Join" link on the OTTO
WG page: http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/OTTO/Home
Members can choose to join as voting or observing (and can change in the
future). As of right now, Hector, Nate and Janusz have signed the participation 
form on the OTTO Wiki. Oliver helps with the membership, if you have
questions.

Quorum is 1/2 + 1 or .5 to get to a majority.

To be a voting member, if you miss three meetings in a row, the chair has 
the discretion to move you to the observer status. If that
happens, notify the person so they can attend the next call to 
ask to re-state their commitment to attend calls.

Minutes: attendence, indicate quorum, approval of previous minutes,
agenda. Capture highlights of the conversations, motions and actions.
Annotate minutes "not-appoved" and change to "approved". Minutes 
should be captured in the wiki (watch out for 90 minute wiki timeout!),
and sent out via email (hopefully get the minutes out well before
the next meeting).

Chair can ask if there are any objections to approving the minutes, 
instead of asking for a motion to approve the minutes.

Try to rely more on consensus than voting. Any substantive issues
should be put to a vote--approval of a draft. Specific changes to 
a document should hopefully just proceed by mutual agreement. If
something is contentious, and you can't reach a consensus, put it 
to a vote. Voting for leadership is also needed.

Kanatara has a Github account, and will create a project for OTTO and 
Mike will assemble a list of github usernames for invitation.

Assign an editor or editors for the OTTO standard. Hear a motion in 
OTTO Workgroup to waive the requirement for a secret ballot, so we
can have an election on the call instead of a week long eballot.

Chair will have the pleasure of joining the bi-weekly Kantara Leadership Call,
to share information across groups. The Leadership council reviews Kantara 
organizational issues and funding.

## Next week
