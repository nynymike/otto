## Kantara Process

Special guest, Joni Brennan, Executive Director for Kantara Initiative will 
brief us on Kantara processes.

Joni says congrats. First thing we have to do is open nominations for
leadership. Positions could be chair, co-chair, and secretary. Send
message to the mailing list, and say anyone who is interested to respond to 
jane or staff@kantarainitiative.org. Collect nominations, leave open for one 
week

Election should be secret ballot by email, so someone could have confidentialty,
i.e. not on the call.

Hector, Nate and Janusz have signed the participation form on the OTTO Wiki

All members must officially join the by completing the 
Group Participation Agreement, OTTO WG from the "Join" link on the OTTO
WG page: http://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/OTTO/Home
Members can choose to join as voting or observing (and can change in the
future). Oliver helps with the membership.

Quorum is 1/2 + 1 or .5 to get to a majority.

To be a voting member, if you miss three meetings in a row, the chair has 
the discretion to move you to the observer status. If that
happens, notify the person so they can attend the next call to 
ask to re-state their commitment to attend calls.

Minutes: attendence, indicate quorum, approval of previous minutes,
agenda. Capture highlights of the conversations, motions and actions.
Annotate minutes "not-appoved" and change to "approved". Minutes 
should be captured in the wiki (watch out for 90 minute wiki timeout!),
and sent out via email (hopefully get the minutes out well before
the next meeting).

Chair can ask if there are any objections to approving the minutes, 
instead of asking for a motion to approve the minutes.

Thy to rely more on consensus than voting. Any substantive issues
should be put to a vote--approval of a draft. Specific changes to 
a document should hopefully just proceed by mutual agreement. If
something is contentious, and you can't reach a consensus, put it 
to a vote. Voting for leadership is also needed.

On Github Kanatara has an account, and will create a project for OTTO and 
Mike will assemble a list of github usernames for invitation.

Assign an editor or editors for the OTTO standard. Hear a motion in 
OTTO Workgroup to waive the requirement for a secret ballot, so we
can have an election on the call instead of a week long eballot.

Chair will have the pleasure of joining the bi-weekly Kantara Leadership Call,
to share information across groups. The Leadership council reviews Kantara 
organizational issues and funding.
