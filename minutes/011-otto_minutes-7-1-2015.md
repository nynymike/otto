2. Kantara logistics
  * Reminder to join the OTTO WG on the Kantara Wiki / Email Mailing List
  * We need more feedback on elections. We are open to all ideas.

3. Discussion of Webfinger and Metadata Query Protocol (MQP)
  * Webfinger section 1 requires resource query param: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033#section-10.1
  * MQP defines how to get a specific entity or all entities. See
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-young-md-query
  * Use of Webfinger query strings (resource / rel) makes Mike nervous about based access control, which
    might be needed for George Fletcher's idea of protected discovery.

4. Next week: Janusz wants to spend a few minutes discussing the federation registration use case.

5. Next week: review Use Cases to focus the scope of OTTO.
