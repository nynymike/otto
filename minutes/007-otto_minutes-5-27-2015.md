## refeds web content: "The Value Proposition for Identity Federations"

Refeds just published an outline:
  https://wiki.refeds.org/display/OUT/The+Value+Proposition+for+Identity+Federations

Perhaps OTTO WG members can contribute a few sections about OAuth2.

## Discussion of Use Cases

- **Trustmark**: It seems like an interesting complimentary idea to central publication
of federation metadata. Its a way to confirm trust without publishing the 
membership list. I guess the trustmark is signed by the federation, so the 
attributes can be confirmed cryptographically.

- **Aggregated Authz** Mike proposed a new use case for federation issued tokens that 
could [aggregate authorizations from multiple UMA authorization servers,
and user claims from multiple OpenID Providers](http://gluu.co/ag-authz) 
He is concerned that issuing tokens is beyond the original anticipated scope,
and perhaps this would be better handled in the UMA WG, which has a backlog
issue to consider authorization scenarios with multiple-AS's. Another concern is 
rushing to define a specify token format.

- **entity-discovery** Not much discussing, this is clearly in scope.

- **Person-enrollment** Need to understand this better. Normally the person is 
enrolled at the IDP? How would the federation's involvment in person enrollment 
helpful?

- **client-registration** Janusz mentioned that this is one of the most important 
use cases for Edugate. Also clearly in scope.

- **security-collaboration** Mike feels strongly that if there is something limited
in scope we can do to support sharing inter-domain threat data between partners,
its worth exploring. We're trying to arrange a guest on the OTTO call to help us
better understand the use case.

- **security-incident-response** Keith mentioned something called Sertify, a
higher education effort to collaborate on security incident response. Parity with 
SAML should be the minimum goal.

- **trust-elevation** Mike thinks that OTTO could faciliate inter-domain trust 
elevation. Although perhaps nothing more is needed than schema alignment.

- **Schema** Not much discussion, looks good.
