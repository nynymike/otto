# Draft Charter

## WG NAME

Open Trust Taxonomy for OAuth2 (OTTO)

## PURPOSE

The working group will develop a set of API's and related data structures to enable an Internet domain to create a multi-party federation, enabling it to manage which OAuth2 entities it trusts, and to publish technical and legal information to drive down the cost of collaboration.

## SCOPE

The API's and data structures will enable discovery of the members of the federation and details about their services, key material and technical capabilities. The final scope will be refined after consideration of the use cases.

## DRAFT TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

- Open Trust Taxonomy for OAuth2 Core Specification
- Open Trust Taxonomy for OAuth2 Metadata Schema Definition
- Schedule Completion of the specifications by 1/15/16

## LEADERSHIP

Co-Chair, Michael Schwartz
Co-Chair, Janusz Ulanowski, Edugate

## AUDIENCE

Existing federation operators and any group of autonomous organizations that need to establish common policies and procedures to drive down the cost of electronic collaboration.

## DURATION 

Working Group would dissolve shortly after the finalization of the standard.

## IPR POLICY 

Kantara Initiative IPR Policy

## RELATED WORK AND LIAISONS 

There is an existing multi-party federation standard for SAML. The WG will also leverage the UMA 1.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 standards, although no specific liaison is needed. There may be some synergies with the OASIS Trust Elevation TC regarding implementation guidelines for authentication to enable trust elevation across federation members.
